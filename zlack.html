            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                This was the first group project I was apart of developed by three other members in class centered
                around the front end. We wanted to create a project that centered around running a business. It
                consist of a welcoming page with a several pictures for aesthetic purposes. When you click on the
                discussion board tab at the top of the page, it takes you to a page that allows the business owner(s)
                and employees to see daily task that need completing as well as chat with each other with live updates.
                The last page consist of a line graph that would allow a business owner to input data into the graph
                so he could see his sales monthly for example.
