            After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. and most times they're friends, like you and me! i
            should've known way back when... because of the kids. but for some reason, you and i react the exact
            same way to water. do you see a little asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside
            on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? hey, look at me when i'm talking to
            you, motherfucker.
