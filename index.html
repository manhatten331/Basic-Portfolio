            <p>
                Programmer with a dedication to building fluid and functional web applications.
                My focus is primarily on back-end development such as JavaScript, Node, MySQL though I do possess
                knowledge of front-end technologies such as CSS and HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
                I hold two degrees: a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Communication.
                With my computing background I have foundational knowledge in the IT field along with high-level
                interpersonal skills needed in the office environment. With my back against the wall I’m ready to take
                on any challenge that is put in my way.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m the quickest learner you will ever meet and I can adapt to any environment I’m put in. What
                continues to drive me down the path as a web developer is the desire to attain as much knowledge as
                possible in the world of software development.

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                This was the first group project I was apart of developed by three other members in class centered
                around the front end. We wanted to create a project that centered around running a business. It
                consist of a welcoming page with a several pictures for aesthetic purposes. When you click on the
                discussion board tab at the top of the page, it takes you to a page that allows the business owner(s)
                and employees to see daily task that need completing as well as chat with each other with live updates.
                The last page consist of a line graph that would allow a business owner to input data into the graph
                so he could see his sales monthly for example.
            </p>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                This was my second group project where my group was able to incorporate back-end functionalities
                into our website such as a server and a database. As a group we wanted to build a site that
                attracted artists and people who wanted to view art. Our landing page welcomes the user with
                animated artwork and shortly sends them to our homepage. Once the user is on the homepage they
                get two simple options: View the artists work or if your an artist post your work to the website.
                The post option requires you to fill out a form to add information to your art so other users know
                who you are, what type of art your showcasing, and a description of the art piece. The view option
                allows users to cycle through the different art such as photography, illustrations, etc. and gain
                information about the artist through what information they chose to fill out.

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                Here is my final project within the full-stack bootcamp where we were encouraged to use our 
                newfound knowledge of React. The theme of the website is supposed to give the user that 
                nostalgic feeling of surfing the web in the 90s. It is centered around the Spotify API 
                where users can simply look up a song through mood, title, album name, or lyrics. Once 
                the desired song is found they can then preview the song. Along with that they can go on 
                the right side of the page and add a journal entry about the song they found. Each journal 
                entry is saved to a specific user where it acts like a diary. We decided to scrap a lot of 
                ideas due to some difficulties with some of the technologies we were trying to incorporate. 
                Hence where the name of this website came from.
